# This configuration file is for the offline secure boot content certificate generation tool 
# cert_sb_content_util.py (Content Certificate Generation Tool - CCGT).
#
# The available parameters in this configuration file are the following
#   • [KEY-CFG]          : Mandatory header.
#          The internal non-configurable header.
#   • cert-keypair       : Mandatory parameter.
#          The file holding the RSA keypair for signing this certificate, in PEM format.
#   • cert-keypair-pwd   : Optional. If omitted the tool prompts for direct input.
#          The passphrase file for the keypair file, in .txt format.
#   • load-verify-scheme : Mandatory parameter.
#          The SW image verification scheme. Supported schemes are:
#             - 0 : Load and verify from flash to memory.
#             - 1 : Full hash verification in Flash, with no loading to memory.
#             - 2 : Verify in memory.
#             - 3 : Load from flash.
#          Note: Option 3 is not recommended and is not allowed in Secure LCS.
#   • crypto-type        : Mandatory parameter.
#          The cryptographic verification and decryption mode:
#             - 0 : Both AES and hash are calculated on the plain image.
#             - 1 : AES is calculated on the plain image, and the hash is calculated on the encrypted image.
#          Note: We recommend that you use the first mode.
#   • aes-ce-id          : Mandatory parameter.
#          The ID of the key used for encryption, matching the entity that signed the certificate chain:
#             - 0 : None.
#             - 1 : Kceicv (ICV).
#             - 2 : Kce (OEM).
#   • aes-enc-key        : Optional. Can be omitted if no encryption is needed.
#          The text file containing the encryption key for the authenticated SW images: Kce or Kceicv.
#          The contents of this file are comma-separated hex Bytes ("0x12,0x34 …") ending with "."
#   • images-table       : Mandatory parameter.
#          The text file containing the list of SW image files to be processed. Each line refers to a single image, 
#          with the following parameters: <image file name> <32b mem load addr> <32b flash store addr> <32b image max size> 
#          <encryption flag: 0 – not encrypted, 1 -encrypted>
#          Notes:
#              - If using loading scheme option 1, the memory address is 0xffffffff (nonexisting address).
#              - If using loading scheme option 2, the storage address is 0xffffffff (non-existing address).
#              - If encryption is used, an output file named <image file name>_enc.bin is created for each encrypted image.
#   • nvcounter-val      : Mandatory parameter.
#          The NV counter value:
#             - 0..64  : The ICV counter.
#             - 0..96  : The OEM counter.
#             - 0..160 : The full counter, if OEM and ICV are a single entity.
#   • cert-pkg           : Mandatory parameter.
#         The content certificate package in binary format.
