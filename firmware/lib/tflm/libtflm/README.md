# About This Repository
This repository builds TensorFlow Lite Micro (TFLM) libraries from the upstream repository. It is meant to be included only as a submodule in the main OpenMV firmware repository. All files in this repository are auto-generated by github workflows.

## Contributing to the project

Contributions are most welcome. If you are interested in contributing to the project, start by creating a fork of the repository:

* https://github.com/openmv/tflm.git

Clone the forked tflm repository, and add a remote to the main tflm repository:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/<username>/tflm.git
git -C tflm remote add upstream https://github.com/openmv/tflm.git
```

Now the repository is ready for pull requests. To send a pull request, create a new feature branch and push it to origin, and use Github to create the pull request from the forked repository to the upstream openmv/tflm repository. For example:
```bash
git checkout -b <some_branch_name>
<commit changes>
git push origin -u <some_branch_name>
```

### Contribution guidelines
Please follow the [best practices](https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/modify/contribute/write_a_good_pr) when sending pull requests upstream. In general, the pull request should:
* Fix one problem. Don't try to tackle multiple issues at once.
* Split the changes into logical groups using git commits.
* Pull request title should be less than 78 characters, and match this pattern:
  * `<scope>:<1 space><description><.>`
* Commit subject line should be less than 78 characters, and match this pattern:
  * `<scope>:<1 space><description><.>`
