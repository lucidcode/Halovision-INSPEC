# SPI Control
#
# This example shows how to use the SPI bus to directly control the LCD shield without
# using the built-in LCD driver. You will need the LCD shield to run this example.

# NOTE: The SPI clock frequency will not always be the requested frequency. The hardware only supports
# frequencies that are the bus frequency divided by a prescaler (which can be 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 or 256).
