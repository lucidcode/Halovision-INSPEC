# SPI Control
#
# This example shows how to use the SPI bus to control the
# 1.8" TFT LCD display (JD-T18003-T01) with ST7735R driver.

# NOTE: The SPI clock frequency will not always be the requested frequency. The hardware only supports
# frequencies that are the bus frequency divided by a prescaler (which can be 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 or 256).

    # connected to your computer. The FPS should increase once disconnected.
