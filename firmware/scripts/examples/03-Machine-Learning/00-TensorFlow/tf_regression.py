# TensorFlow Lite Regression Example
#
# This example shows off running a regression model on the OpenMV Cam.
# A regression model takes an input list of numbers and produces an
# output list of numbers. You may pass ndarrays arrays to predict()
# and you will get a list of the results back.
#
# Note: The input list of numbers must be the same size as the input
# tensor size of the model.

import ml
from ulab import numpy as np

# The model is built-in on the RT1062. On other OpenMV Cam's with limited flash space please grab
# the model from here: https://github.com/openmv/openmv/tree/master/src/lib/tflm/models and
# copy it to the OpenMV Cam's file system. E.g. model = ml.Model("force_int_quant.tflite")
model = ml.Model("force_int_quant")
print(model)

print(model.predict([i])[0])
# Should print 53.78332
