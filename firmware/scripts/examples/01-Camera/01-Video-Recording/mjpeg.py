# MJPEG Video Recording Example
#
# Note: You will need an SD card to run this demo.
#
# You can use your OpenMV Cam to record mjpeg files. You can either feed the
# recorder object JPEG frames or RGB565/Grayscale frames. Once you've finished
# recording a Mjpeg file you can use VLC to play it. If you are on Ubuntu then
# the built-in video player will work too.

sensor.reset()  # Reset and initialize the sensor.
sensor.set_pixformat(sensor.RGB565)  # Set pixel format to RGB565 (or GRAYSCALE)
sensor.set_framesize(sensor.QVGA)  # Set frame size to QVGA (320x240)
sensor.skip_frames(time=2000)  # Wait for settings take effect.
