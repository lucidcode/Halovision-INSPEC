# GIF Video Recording on Movement Example
#
# Note: You will need an SD card to run this example.
#
# You can use your OpenMV Cam to record gif files. You can either feed the
# recorder object RGB565 frames or Grayscale frames. Use photo editing software
# like GIMP to compress and optimize the Gif before uploading it to the web.
#
# This example demonstrates using frame differencing with your OpenMV Cam to do
# motion detection. After motion is detected your OpenMV Cam will take video.
