provision which most nearly effects the parties intent in entering into this LLA.
The delay or failure by ST to enforce any provisions of this LLA or to exercise any right in respect thereto shall not be construed
as constituting a waiver of any right of ST or obligation of Licensee.
No agency, joint venture, partnership or other business organization shall be created or be construed as being created by

Licensee agrees that ST’s Affiliates are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this LLA.
Licensee agrees that in the event of any breach of this LLA by Licensee or its contractors, the resulting harm to ST and its

Affiliates shall be entitled to seek specific performance, injunction, and other equitable relief.

or in connection with this LLA shall be finally settled by the competent courts of Geneva, Switzerland. Licensee hereby waives

injunctive or equitable relief by a court of competent jurisdiction.
