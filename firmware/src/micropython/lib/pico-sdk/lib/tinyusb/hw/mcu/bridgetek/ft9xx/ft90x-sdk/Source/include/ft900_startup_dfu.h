    @brief
    Startup DFU Feature.

	@details
    The Startup DFU library allows application to enable the USB device on the
    FT900 temporarily to present a DFU interface to the USB host. Software on
    the USB host can then update the application stored in Flash on the FT900
    regardless of the functionality or features of the existing application.

    The feature can be added to any application by adding a call to the function
    STARTUP_DFU. This call can be made under any conditions - maybe a button
    press at power-up detected by a GPIO or just unconditionally when the
    application is started.

    The USB interface remains active for a short period of time (~200ms) and
    once activated by enumeration from the USB host will continue to stay active
    for around 1000ms after activity has ceased.

    This file contains Startup DFU feature function definitions, constants
    and structures which are exposed in the API.

    Note that as this is a USB device all transaction nomenclature is from the
    point of view from the host. If the device sends data to the host then it
    is called an IN transaction, if it receives data from the host then it is
    an OUT transaction.
