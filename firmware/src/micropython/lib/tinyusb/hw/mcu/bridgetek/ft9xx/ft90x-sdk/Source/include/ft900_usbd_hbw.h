    @brief
    USB Device High Bandwidth Isochronous IN support API on FT90x Rev C onwards.

    This contains USB Device High Bandwidth Isochronous IN support
    API function definitions, constants and structures
    which are exposed in the API.

    Note that as this is a USB device all transaction nomenclature is from the
    point of view from the host. If the device sends data to the host then it
    is called an IN transaction, if it receives data from the host then it is
    an OUT transaction.
