/**
 @brief     Initialise the AOA driver.
 @details	Setup a context for the AOA driver to use the interfaces and settings
 	 	 	 provided in the call.
			The sequence for connecting to AOA devices is:
			1) Check AOA protocol is valid. This means that the special vendor SETUP
			command works and the return value is non-zero and matches a protocol
			version supported by the driver.
			2) Send string descriptors to the AOA device using the vendor SETUP
			commands. Then send a start accessory device vendor SETUP command.
			3) The device re-enumerates by doing a device reset.
			4) The host re-enumerates the device as an Android accessory.
			The device will need to be attached using USBH_AOA_attach() once it has
			been re-enumerated.
 @param		hAOAInterface - handle to the AOA interface to use.
 @param		ctx - structure instantiated in the application to hold the context
 	 	 	 information for this instance of the driver.
 @param		descriptors - pointer to a structure containing string descriptors
 	 	 	 to send to the AOA device.
 @param		audio - if the protocol supports audio then send the enable audio
 	 	 	 command to the accessory to enable the audio interface.
 @returns   USBH_AOA_STARTED if an Android accessory device in it's normal mode
 	 	 	 was detected. It will have been started as an accessory and will
 	 	 	 therefore perform a device reset and be re-enumerated.
			USBH_AOA_DETECTED if an Android accessory device in accessory mode
			 was detected. This device can now be attached and used.
			USBH_AOA_ERR_CLASS_NOT_SUPPORTED if a device which is not an Android
			 accessory was detected.
