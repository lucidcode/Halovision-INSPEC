# The pin_cap_table is a subset from table 6-1 of the data sheet.
# It  contain the information about pin mux set and pad
# for some of the peripheral devices with many possible assignments.
# The colums represent the peripheral class, as defined in pin_cap_t. The
# column number is equivalent to the mux class.
# The eic and adc columns contain the decimal numer for the respecitive
# quantity, the columns for sercom, tc and tcc have in each cell
# the device number in the first, and the pad number in the second
# digit. If a signal is not available, the cell in the csv table is left empty.
# The first column is the pin id, not the number of the board pin.
# Rows not starting with pa, pb, pc or pd are ignored.
# When editing the table with a spread sheet, take care to import the data as text.
